## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-19

LSP build-out. The stdio language server gains nine new
capabilities so editors can drive `.ush` files the same way they
drive Rust, TypeScript, etc. — without any change to the existing
`ush check` / `ush format` / `publishDiagnostics` / `semanticTokens`
plumbing.

### Added

- `textDocument/documentHighlight` — every occurrence of the
  identifier under the cursor.
- `textDocument/documentSymbol` — outline of top-level `fn` / `enum`
  / `trait` / `type` / `let` / `alias`.
- `textDocument/foldingRange` — `{ … }` block folding, correctly
  ignoring braces inside strings, line comments, and `#[…]`
  attributes.
- `textDocument/hover` — Markdown tooltip: keyword help, or "role +
  declaring line" for an identifier.
- `textDocument/completion` — every `.ush` keyword plus every
  identifier the semantic tokenizer has classified in the open
  document.
- `textDocument/definition` — first occurrence of the identifier
  under the cursor.
- `textDocument/references` — every occurrence of the identifier
  under the cursor.
- `textDocument/prepareRename` — range to highlight before the
  rename popup.
- `textDocument/rename` — `WorkspaceEdit` with one `TextEdit` per
  occurrence; rejects new names that are not valid `.ush`
  identifiers with a clear LSP error.
- `textDocument/signatureHelp` — `(` / `,` triggers a popup with the
  function signature, parameter list, and the currently-active
  parameter index.

### Changed

- Each LSP engine lives in `crates/ush_tooling` as a pure-Rust,
  editor-agnostic module (`highlight`, `symbol`, `folding`, `hover`,
  `completion`, `references`, `signature`); the LSP wire layer in
  `apps/ush_lsp` is responsible only for `lsp_types` conversion and
  routing.
- `docs/lsp.md` documents every implemented capability and its
  backing module, plus the methods that still need typed-info work.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-19

A polish-pass release on top of 0.7.0's production-readiness work.
Focus is CI hardening, contributor-facing docs, and shared
infrastructure.

### Added

- `MAINTAINERS.md` and `SUPPORT.md` for community-health coverage.
- `scripts/preflight.sh` runs every gate CI runs, in the same order,
  behind a single `sh scripts/preflight.sh`.
- `docs/architecture.md` — top-down map of the workspace + symptom
  → file table; `docs/release-process.md` indexed from the docs
  README; `docs/release-process.md` referenced from the README's
  Release section.
- New CI jobs / steps: dedicated **`no_std` clippy** gate, every
  `.ush` example dogfooded through `ush format --check`, and an
  end-to-end LSP `initialize/shutdown/exit` smoke test.
- CLI smoke test now covers `ush compile` and `ush check`.
- Crate-level rustdoc on `ush_compiler`, `ush_shell`, `ush_tooling`,
  and `ush_config` so `cargo doc` / docs.rs no longer show blank
  summaries.
- `apps/ush` now installs a user-facing panic hook that prints a
  triage-ready message + tracker link.
- `.github/labeler.yml` auto-labels PRs by changed paths;
  `.github/CODEOWNERS` auto-requests review.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` adds an issue chooser with
  links to the security advisory form, release process, and
  architecture overview.
- Dependabot now also watches the `cargo` ecosystem in
  security-advisory-only mode.
- README adds a "Production readiness" section + CodeQL / Secret
  scan badges.

### Changed

- **CI concurrency** — every workflow's `concurrency.group` is now
  keyed on `run_id` for main pushes, so successive merges no longer
  cancel each other.
- **MSRV** bumped from 1.88 to **1.89** (vendored rustyline uses
  `std::fs::File::lock`, stabilised in 1.89).
- **Workspace stable rustfmt** — re-formatted with
  `rustfmt --edition 2024` so CI's import-sort matches the local
  edition-2024 layout.
- **PR template** — wider validation checklist + a `## Security`
  block; matches what current CI runs.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** documents the rustfmt + edition-2024 gotcha
  and the `scripts/preflight.sh` shortcut.
- **cargo-deny** graph is now restricted to the four released
  targets; `bans.multiple-versions = "deny"` with a single
  `bitflags@1.3.2` skip; BSL-1.0 added to the allowed-license set.
- **GitHub Actions** — every third-party action is pinned to a
  full commit SHA (with a trailing comment giving the human-readable
  version) to remove the trust-on-first-use risk of mutable major
  tags.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-19

A production-readiness release. Everything below was previously
tracked under `[Unreleased]`.

### Added

- Started this changelog. Older releases are summarised below from the
  GitHub release notes; future releases should land their entries here
  first under `[Unreleased]` and then be cut into a version section.
- `SECURITY.md` with a private-disclosure policy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing the local-CI flow and project layout,
  plus a `scripts/preflight.sh` one-command CI mirror.
- Issue and pull-request templates under `.github/`, plus a
  `CODEOWNERS` file.
- `docs/release-process.md` documenting the pre-flight checklist,
  the matrix of published artefacts, and the rollback procedure.
- Root-level `.editorconfig` pins charset / EOL / indent.
- `Shellcheck` CI workflow lints `install.sh` and every
  `scripts/*.sh`.
- `Benchmark` CI job tracks parser and full `.ush → sh` compile-time
  benchmarks against the `main` baseline (on `gh-pages`) and fails
  PRs on >25% regression.
- `Deny` CI job runs `cargo-deny` for license / source / advisory /
  bans enforcement.
- `CodeQL` and `Gitleaks` workflows add SAST and secret-scanning to
  every PR and to a weekly cron.
- Compiler now enforces `match` exhaustiveness during the effects
  pass: missing variants on enums, missing arms on `Bool` and `Unit`,
  and literal-only matches on `String` / `Int` / tuples / lists are
  now rejected with a clear diagnostic instead of compiling to a
  silently-fall-through shell branch.
- New CI gate: every `examples/*.ush` is type-checked through
  `ush check` *and* `ush format --check`.
- README links the CI / Shellcheck / Dependencies workflow badges
  and the MIT shield.
- `.dockerignore` keeps the docker build context lean; the docker
  image now runs as the non-root `ush` user (uid 1000).
- Linux `aarch64` release archive (`ush-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`).
- `ush_lsp` gains `--version` / `-V` and `--help` / `-h` flags.
- `ush` gains a user-facing panic hook that prints a triage-ready
  message instead of a raw rustc panic.

### Changed

- Workspace declares `rust-version = "1.88"` as the MSRV (bumped
  during the 0.7.0 cycle to match what `criterion` and `home`
  require).
- CI matrixes `clippy` and `test` jobs across Ubuntu and macOS, adds
  an MSRV gate, runs `cargo audit` and `cargo deny`, gates rustdoc
  on warnings, and runs the `no_std` test suite (not just `cargo
  check`).
- Workflow `concurrency.group` is now keyed on `run_id` for `main`
  pushes so successive merges don't cancel each other.
- Shell signal helpers use `sigaction(2)` instead of `signal(3)`, and
  the SIGCONT pgid path rejects PIDs that do not fit `pid_t`.
- The compiler refuses to silently fall back when `canonicalize()`
  fails; the codegen invariant for control-flow statements is now
  an error rather than `unreachable!()`.
- The formatter no longer mis-parses `#[attr]` as a line comment,
  fixing un-indented function bodies after parameter attributes.
- `install.sh` hardens its trust surface: `umask 077`, best-effort
  `set -o pipefail`, no more clobber of the caller's `$TMPDIR`, and
  `curl` / `wget` flags pin HTTPS + TLS 1.2 with retries on remote
  URLs (local `file://` URLs in CI smoke-tests bypass these flags).
- Release-binary profile now strips debuginfo, runs thin-LTO with a
  single codegen unit, and uses `panic = "abort"`. The Linux/macOS
  release archives drop from ~5.6 MB to ~2.9 MB for `ush` and from
  ~2.7 MB to ~1.3 MB for `ush_lsp`.
- Workspace-wide lints deny `todo!()`, `dbg!()`, `unimplemented!()`,
  and `unused_must_use`.
- Cargo manifests carry full metadata (`description`, `repository`,
  `homepage`, `readme`, `keywords`, `categories`, `authors`). Apps
  are `publish = false`.
- `ush --help` and `ush_lsp --help` now document every flag and
  subcommand.
