## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Started this changelog. Older releases are summarised below from the
  GitHub release notes; future releases should land their entries here
  first under `[Unreleased]` and then be cut into a version section.
- `SECURITY.md` with a private-disclosure policy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing the local-CI flow and project layout.
- Issue and pull-request templates under `.github/`.

### Changed

- Workspace declares `rust-version = "1.85"` as the MSRV.
- CI matrixes `clippy` and `test` jobs across Ubuntu and macOS, adds
  an MSRV gate, and runs `cargo audit` (also on a weekly schedule).
- Shell signal helpers use `sigaction(2)` instead of `signal(3)`, and
  the SIGCONT pgid path rejects PIDs that do not fit `pid_t`.
- The compiler refuses to silently fall back when `canonicalize()`
  fails; the codegen invariant for control-flow statements is now an
  error rather than `unreachable!()`.
